# OVS

### What is OVS?
The Online Voting System is a project aimed at modernizing the traditional voting process and making it more efficient and secure. It utilizes Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and MySQL to create a user-friendly web application for conducting elections.

### Key Features:
**Improved Voting System**: The project enhances the voting process by moving it online, enabling voters to cast their ballots quickly and conveniently from any location with internet access.

**Facial Recognition for User Authentication**: To ensure the security and prevent fraudulent voting, the system uses facial recognition technology to authenticate voters. This ensures that only authorized individuals can participate in the election.

**System-Generated Unique ID and Password**: Each voter is provided with a unique identification number and password during registration. These credentials add an extra layer of security to the login process, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

**Admin Verification of Candidate Documents**: The system enables the election administrator to verify the documents and details of each candidate before they are listed on the ballot. This helps in ensuring that only eligible and qualified candidates participate in the election.

**Voters' Access to Candidate Background**: The voters have the ability to view the background information of each candidate, such as their education, work experience, and past accomplishments. This transparency allows voters to make informed decisions when casting their votes.
